<p>Marie Louise Hvidman and Signe Maria Friis has created a collaborative piece, in which they explore the potentially symbiotic relationship created in the interaction between their respective creative processes and materials - textile and latex. <br>They work with shapes and objects that often refer or relate to the human anatomy and form. Textile becoming clothing and latex becoming skin. Both of them are interested in the tactility of materials and in this piece the two materials are investigated thoroughly. Throughout the process the materials used have been allowed to multiply and transform freely into new shapes, languages and expressions.<br><br>Check out their other work at:<br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/signemariafriis/">https://www.instagram.com/signemariafriis/</a><br><br>And<br><br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/marielouisehv/">https://www.instagram.com/marielouisehv/</a></p>
